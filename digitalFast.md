# Digital Fast Journal

Today (Wed, Nov 10) I start my digital fast from TikTok. TikTok is a popular media streaming platform with more than a million users that became famous during the pandemic. One can share short video clips and get likes, comments, and follows from other users.

I am starting this fast as I find myself scrolling mindlessly through dozens of videos daily, anywhere between 30 minutes to hours. It is a way to destress for me from classes, work, and social interactions that take place during the day. I hope to end this fast with a more clear mind and more conscious media consumption.

The hardest day of all! The first day without TikTok -- I deleted the app and reduced my time spent on Instagram and Facebook through the iPhone settings. Spent a lot of time scrolling Instagram as I didn't have access to TikTok.

The day passed very quickly since I was anticipating my friend's birthday celebration in the evening. It was tempting to check the feed in the morning, but I resisted the urge just by checking Instagram. In the evening, I didn't think about social media at all as I was spending time with my friends.

I've spent the majority of the day today working on a project for one of my classes. At the end of the day, I had an urge to check social media to "destress". I checked Facebook and Instagram but avoided TikTok.

Today was the easiest day to manage without TikTok as I was traveling to Dubai and was too busy doing other things that didn't involve being on my phone.

Again, was busy attending meetings and working on homework to check my phone. Got a temptation to check the feed on Instagram in the evening, but watched educational / calming YouTube videos instead :)

A full day of classes! Today I was responsible for sharing parts of my day on Instagram for my high school's student organization account as an alumni, so this took the majority of my day on social media. Managing it quite well without TikTok and am getting kind of tired of Instagram too.

Last day of the fast! Wow, time passed much quicker than I thought it would :D Although I still feel like downloading TikTok again (especially because I enjoy creating videos from time to time as well), I definitely feel less attachment to it. Yesterday and today were the shortest times spent on my phone in general. This digital fast prompted me to think if social media creators -- who make content as their job or people who do it just for fun -- would also benefit from taking time off? Normally, we wouldn't expect people to suddenly take breaks from their work, unless it's a holiday or a special leave, so does the same framework apply to creators and bloggers?
